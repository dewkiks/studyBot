### Project Description
Study Bot is an AI-powered assistant designed to help students with their academic queries. It provides instant answers to study-related questions, generates quizzes, and suggests learning resources to enhance the study experience.

### The Problem statement
Students often struggle with finding quick and accurate answers to their academic questions. Traditional search engines provide overwhelming or irrelevant results, making it difficult for students to focus on their studies effectively. 

### The Solution
We built Study Botâ€”an AI-driven chatbot that delivers precise, subject-specific answers, generates quizzes for self-assessment, and recommends study materials tailored to the user's needs.
